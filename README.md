# Poultry-Production-Cost-Analysis.xlsx.
Quantitative analysis of livestock production financials: An undergraduate project involving comprehensive field data capture and in-depth financial modeling using Excel tools to determine cost per unit and optimize resource allocation.
## 📍 Background

This project was completed during the COVID-19 pandemic as part of my practical training for the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) program.

Due to lockdown limitations, the practical component was conducted locally in India, in collaboration with small and medium-scale farmers from rural areas. I collected firsthand data on feed costs, veterinary expenses, labor, and output to analyze the cost of production in real-world livestock farming systems.

Working directly with local farmers provided valuable insights into the economic challenges faced by rural livestock owners. The project allowed me to bridge academic knowledge with practical, on-ground realities and laid the foundation for my growing interest in data-driven livestock management and animal nutrition.

## 📌 Project Aim

To evaluate the cost of production in small and medium-scale animal farms, and identify key areas to improve efficiency and profitability.

---

## 📈 Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel  
- Field-based data collection (feed, labor, veterinary expenses, outputs)

---

## 🎯 Relevance

This project connects directly to my research interests in **animal nutrition**, **data-driven farm management**, and my long-term goal of building a sustainable **mixed farming venture** that integrates both crop and livestock systems.

It also marks the beginning of my transition into **technology-assisted farm analysis**, as I aim to convert this work into Python-based code for deeper, automated insights.
